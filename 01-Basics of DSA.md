# Data Structure in Simple Points:

- Data structure is a way of storing and organizing data on a computer.
- It helps in efficient access and update of data.
- Data structures are used for processing, retrieving, and storing data.
- They are essential for organizing and managing data in memory.
- Different types of data structures exist, with their own characteristics and features.
- Each data structure has its own advantages and disadvantages.
- Choosing the right data structure depends on the specific task or application.
- Understanding data structures is crucial for developing software and programs.
- This article provides a complete guide on types, classifications, and applications of data structures.
- The goal is to help readers choose the most suitable data structure quickly.

## Data type Vs Data Structure

| | Data Type | Data Structure |
|---|---|---|
| Definition            | Represents the form or type of a variable                       | Represents a collection of different data                      |
| Value Storage         | Holds values of a specific data type                            | Can hold multiple types of data within a single object         |
| Implementation        | Abstract implementation                                       | Concrete implementation                                      |
| Time Complexity       | No time complexity                                            | Time complexity plays a role                                 |
| Data Storage          | Does not store data, only represents the type                   | Stores data and its values in computer memory                 |
| Examples              | int, float, double, etc.                                      | stack, queue, tree, etc.                                      |

## Classification of Data Structure in Simple Points:

- Linear data structure: Data elements arranged sequentially with each element connected to its previous and next elements. Examples: array, stack, queue, linked list.
- Static data structure: Fixed memory size, easy access to elements. Example: array.
- Dynamic data structure: Size not fixed, can be updated during runtime. Examples: queue, stack.
- Non-linear data structure: Data elements not placed sequentially, traversal requires multiple runs. Examples: trees, graphs.
