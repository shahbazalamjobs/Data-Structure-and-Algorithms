# Data Structure in Simple Points:

- Data structure is a way of storing and organizing data on a computer.
- It helps in efficient access and update of data.
- Data structures are used for processing, retrieving, and storing data.
- They are essential for organizing and managing data in memory.
- Different types of data structures exist, with their own characteristics and features.
- Each data structure has its own advantages and disadvantages.
- Choosing the right data structure depends on the specific task or application.
- Understanding data structures is crucial for developing software and programs.
- This article provides a complete guide on types, classifications, and applications of data structures.
- The goal is to help readers choose the most suitable data structure quickly.

## Data type Vs Data Structure

| | Data Type | Data Structure |
|---|---|---|
| Definition            | Represents the form or type of a variable                       | Represents a collection of different data                      |
| Value Storage         | Holds values of a specific data type                            | Can hold multiple types of data within a single object         |
| Implementation        | Abstract implementation                                       | Concrete implementation                                      |
| Time Complexity       | No time complexity                                            | Time complexity plays a role                                 |
| Data Storage          | Does not store data, only represents the type                   | Stores data and its values in computer memory                 |
| Examples              | int, float, double, etc.                                      | stack, queue, tree, etc.                                      |

## Classification of Data Structure:

- Linear data structure: Data elements arranged sequentially with each element connected to its previous and next elements. Examples: array, stack, queue, linked list.
- Static data structure: Fixed memory size, easy access to elements. Example: array.
- Dynamic data structure: Size not fixed, can be updated during runtime. Examples: queue, stack.
- Non-linear data structure: Data elements not placed sequentially, traversal requires multiple runs. Examples: trees, graphs.

## Need Of Data structure :
- The structure of the data and the synthesis of the algorithm are relative to each other.
- Data presentation must be easy to understand so the developer, as well as the user, can make an efficient implementation of the operation.
- Data structures provide an easy way of organizing, retrieving, managing, and storing data.

**********

## Here is a list of the needs for data.
- Data structure modification is easy. 
- It requires less time.
- Save storage memory space.
- Data representation is easy.
- Easy access to the large database.

**********

## Array

- Linear Structure: Arrays are linear data structures storing items in contiguous memory locations.
- Collection of Items: They hold multiple items of the same type in one place.
- Efficient Data Processing: Arrays allow processing a large amount of data quickly.
- Zero-Based Indexing: The first element is accessed using a subscript of 0.
- Array Operations: Arrays support various operations like searching, sorting, inserting, traversing, reversing, and deleting.

## Characteristics of an Array:

- Index-Based Structure: Arrays use indexes to easily identify and access individual elements.
- Efficient Storage: Arrays are suitable for storing multiple values of the same data type efficiently.
- Handling Complex Data: Arrays can handle complex data structures by using multi-dimensional arrays.
- Implementation of Other Data Structures: Arrays are used to implement various data structures like Stacks, Queues, Hash tables, etc.
- Easy Search Process: Searching for specific elements in an array is straightforward.

## Operations performed on an Array:

- Initialization: Arrays can be initialized during declaration or later using assignment statements.
- Accessing Elements: Elements in an array are accessed using their index, starting from 0.
- Searching for Elements: Arrays can be searched using linear search or binary search algorithms.
- Sorting Elements: Elements in an array can be sorted using sorting algorithms like bubble sort, insertion sort, or quick sort.
- Inserting Elements: Elements can be inserted into an array, but it requires shifting existing elements.
- Deleting Elements: Elements can be deleted from an array by shifting the subsequent elements to fill the gap.
- Updating Elements: Elements in an array can be modified by assigning a new value to a specific index.
- Traversing Elements: The elements in an array can be traversed in order, visiting each element once.
